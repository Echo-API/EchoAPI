# Create a ZIP file for Chrome Web Store submission
zip -r echoapi-extension.zip . -x "*.git*" "node_modules/*" "*.md"

 Permissions
The extension requires the following permissions:

activeTab - Access the current tab's URL for context
storage - Save request history and user preferences
host_permissions - Make requests to external APIs
https://*/* - HTTPS endpoints
http://*/* - HTTP endpoints (for development/testing)

  Limitations
CORS Restrictions - Can only test APIs that allow cross-origin requests
Authentication - Limited to header-based auth (no OAuth flows)
File Uploads - Does not support multipart/form-data file uploads
WebSocket - Only supports HTTP/HTTPS, not WebSocket connections

 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"CORS Error" or "Network Error"

The API doesn't allow cross-origin requests from browser extensions
Try using a CORS proxy or test the API directly in a tool like Postman
"Invalid URL" Error

Ensure the URL includes the protocol (http:// or https://)
Check for typos in the URL
Request Timeout

The API might be slow or unresponsive
Default timeout is 10 seconds
Extension Not Loading

Refresh the extension by going to chrome://extensions/ and clicking the refresh icon
Check the Chrome console for error messages
